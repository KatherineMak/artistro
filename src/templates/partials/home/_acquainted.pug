                    p.mb-5 I am Ellie Grin and here Iâ€™ve talked briefly about what I do.
                    p.mb-5 Art has attracted me since my childhood. Until today, I managed to try out a lot of things associated with drawing and decorating decorative details. it was the drawing of fabrics, products from polymer clay.
                    p.mb-10 But this cannot be compared with decorating glass products. Absolutely everything can be made bright and unique, adding to it a little saturated colors and a special meaning. Personalized glassware is especially popular because it is so nice to receive dishes with your name or with warm words for your heart!
